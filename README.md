# House Price Prediction â€“ Heroku-Deployed Flask Web App

A machine learning web application built with **Flask** to predict house prices using a **Linear Regression** model. The app was containerised in a virtual environment and deployed to **Heroku** via the CLI. For details on model development and local Flask deployment, see the companion repository: [ML-Based-House-Price-Prediction-Web-App](https://github.com/UdonnaM/ML-Based-House-Price-Prediction-Web-App)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how a simple machine learning model for house price prediction can be deployed as a live web app using Flask and hosted on Heroku. The model was trained using `scikit-learn`, wrapped in a Python Flask server, and served via HTML templates.

---

## Features

* Clean UI for inputting house-related features
* Predicts house prices in real-time using a trained Linear Regression model
* Virtual environment setup for dependency isolation
* Hosted on Heroku with public accessibility

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates the complete cycle of building, containerising, and deploying a machine learning web application using Flask and Linear Regression. It highlights key skills such as model integration into a web framework, virtual environment management, and cloud deployment via the Heroku CLI. While the primary goal was deployment, this project also reflects best practices in organising machine learning pipelines for real-world use.

The successful deployment marks the culmination of local development efforts and showcases practical knowledge in full-stack machine learning workflows.
